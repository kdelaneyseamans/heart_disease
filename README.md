In this project, I used large set of historical data to analyze relationships between different attributes of a house (such as square footage or the number of bathrooms) and the houseâ€™s selling price. I created different regression models (logistic regression and random forests) to predict sale prices for houses based on critical variable factors. These regression models could help a company set better prices when listing a home for a client. Setting better prices will ensure that listings can be sold within a reasonable amount of time.
